# Toura - Travel assistance app

## History
During my internship at HamsanTech (SMC-Private) Limited (website link) , I had the valuable opportunity to gain hands-on experience in cross-platform Mobile Application Development using React-Native. In the concluding phases of the internship, we were tasked with designing a mobile app aimed at solving a real-world problem. I conceptualized "Toura" — a travel assistance app that simplifies and streamlines travel across Pakistan.
I integrated numerous features into the application, such as email authentication and verification for sign-in, dynamic animations, optimized search functionality, profile customization, shopping cart management, specialized recommendations based on your wish list, and more.
In the following report I have tried to incorporate most of the screens of my application and give a brief supporting explanation for each

## Screens

When the app launches the following screen appears with a zoom in  animation

Before signing up it is essential to have your registration verified. An email is sent out to the email address from where the registration is made. Only after the verification is complete the account is registered.
